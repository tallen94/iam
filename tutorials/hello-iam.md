# Hello Iam


## Sign Up

Welcome to Iam. Please follow the onscreen prompts and come back to this tutorial after completing the form.

Select `New` if you are a new user.

## Home
The screen you are taken to is the `Home` screen. The navigation for the system is to the left, where you can create and select items. 

Selected items will appear in the middle of the page and allow you to edit their values.

You can navigate between recent visited items by using the arrow keys near the top.

### Clusters

- Create your first cluster by hitting the `+` next to the `Clusters` in the navigation. 
- Enter in a name, perhaps __main__, and click `Create`.


*Note: After clicking the `Create` button you need to save what was created by hitting the `edit` button, followed by the `save` button in the 
top right.*

Now you have a cluster created where you can add environments to it.

- Edit the description to something a little better, perhaps *"This is my first cluster and is for testing purposes"*


### Environments
An Environment describes a set of dependencies and resources for allocation in the Cluster.

- Create an Environment
  - Click the `+` button in the navigation bar or,
  - Click `Add Environment` when a __Cluster__ is selected in the editor.  
- Enter in a name, perhaps __base__, and click `Create`


*Note: After clicking the `Create` button you need to save what was created by hitting the `edit` button, followed by the `save` button in the 
top right.*

There is more information in an Environment than a Cluster. It starts with a good description though.

The __State__ informs you if the Environment is available for use. Currently, your environment is __Stopped__.


- To start the Environment, click `start` in the top right. The state should move to __Running__. 
- To stop the Environment, click `stop` in the top right. The state should move to __Stopped__.

Make sure your Environment is __Running__ before continuing.
