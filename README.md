# Iam: Distributed Computing Platform

Iam is a space for collaborating and building. Use it to: 
- Create instantly available, autoscaling data pipelines. 
- Combine code snippets that are instantly available through an api and re-usable in other pipelines. 

A single interface provides all the tools to write and experiment with code on a highly scalable, highly available cluster. Machine Learning engineers need a way to minimize complexity in getting experimentation code into a production size computing environment. 

This platform enables the same freedom and iteration speed as developing locally with tools like Jupyter Notebook. Transitioning code from a notebook to a highly scalable platform requires no additional effort from the developer, other than copying it from one editor to another.

## Iam Cluster
An Iam cluster is deployed to Kubernetes for creating environments that comprise of a Dockerfile and Kubernetes object yaml files. It stores your code, Dockerfiles and Kubernetes object files. Work with a simple user interface to manage your environments and code.
