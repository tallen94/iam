The basic components of cloud applications are data stores and programs

Executables:
  QUERIES
  PROGRAMS
  COMMANDS
  STEPLISTS

Use QERIES to interact with data stores
  - Stores data in an relational MySQL table
Use PROGRAMS to manipulate or analyze data
  - PROGRAMS can also obtain data from sources like 3rd party Api's
  - Supports any interpreted language
Use STEPLISTS to combine these basic operations into data pipelines
  - Automatically parallelize and distribute on a cluster
Use JOBS to schedule any executable on some frequency

Use Cases:

Scraping websites
  - Use a PROGRAM to scrape data from a website
  - Combine with a QUERY to save data into the data store
  - Schedule a JOB to run frequently

Machine learning pipelines
  - Create a program to train data using LinearRegression
  - Train large sets of data in parallel using multiple models to compare results
  - Cross validate in parallel distributed across the cluster

Business application development
  - Create simple user authentication flows
  - Interact with 3rd party api's without creating infrastructure
  - Generate credit card registration flows to create a simple payment Api


StepLists:
d = data
e = executable

Synchronous execution
  En(...Ei+2(Ei+1(Ei(D))))

Asynchronous execution
  
  [Ei(Di), Ei+1(Di+1), Ei+2(Di+2) ... En(Dn)]

  [E(Di), E(Di+1), E(Di+2) ... E(Dn)]
